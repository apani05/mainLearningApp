## Abstract
Preserving endangered languages is essential for maintaining cultural identity. Blackfoot is categorized as endangered, with nearly 2,900 speakers remaining. Existing solutions for preserving Blackfoot lack engagement, accessibility, community learning, and gamified experiences. To address this, we developed “I’poyít – Blackfoot Language Learning Application,” a cross-platform app designed to facilitate learning and preservation. In collaboration with the University of Montana, the application features content from researchers and linguists.

The primary objective of our development was to establish a codebase that is both maintainable and robust. This culturally sensitive and interactive application utilizes the Flutter framework for cross-platform compatibility and Firebase for backend services, which provide real-time updates and data storage. State management was handled using Riverpod, ensuring optimization across the application. This approach led to enhanced performance by decoupling UI components from business logic. Loading performance was optimized through asynchronous programming, ensuring minimal delays and seamless navigation. The real-time database capabilities of Firebase provided instant synchronization and updating of user data. Flutter’s integration with Firebase enabled users to upload audio files, which were then instantly accessible to all users. The features were designed to be easily extendable, allowing new functionality to be added with minimal changes to existing code.

The key features of the application include vocabulary flashcards, a phrases learning module with audio translations from native speakers, and customizable quizzes with detailed visual analytics to provide an immersive experience. Gamified elements, such as XP points, a leaderboard, and a robust notification system, ensure daily study engagement. User profile management and discussion forums stimulate community engagement. A content management system was designed for efficient phrase management, batch uploading, and fault-tolerant multimedia integration. “I’poyít” demonstrates the potential for cross-platform accessibility to improve language learning and preserve the Blackfoot language. By combining modern technology with cultural insights, the application offers an engaging and effective learning experience, highlighting the potential for similar solutions to support other endangered languages.
